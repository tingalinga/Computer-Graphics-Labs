## Lab 2

The purpose of this lab is to draw a planet with a number of cars each following their own great circle on the planet. The cars should be drawn using only GLUT functions such as `glutSolidCube()` or `glutSolidTorus()` with the aid of matrix transformations.

The user should be able to switch view position and the near and far planes should be set near the planetâ€™s surface, yet still do not clip off any part of the planet and cars.

A preview of the program can be seen here:
