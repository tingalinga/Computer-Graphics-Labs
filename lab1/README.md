## Lab 1

The purpose of this lab is to make a window where you can press with your mouse, and a circle drawn using `GL_TRIANGLE_FAN` is drawn at that point with a random radius, velocity and color. When a circles hits the walls, they are reflected with no energy loss.

The window should handle window resizing properly.

A preview of the program can be seen here:
