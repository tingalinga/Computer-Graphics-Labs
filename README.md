## Computer Graphics repo

This is my repository for the programs I develop at the course in Computer Graphics. The code is written in C++ and uses OpenGL and Glut.


Given that source file is `main.cpp`, this is how the files should be compiled and run on macOS/Linux:

```
$ gcc main.cpp -o main -framework GLUT -framework OpenGL -Wall -Wextra -Wno-deprecated
$ ./main
```
