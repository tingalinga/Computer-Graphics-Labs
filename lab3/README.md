## Lab 3

The purpose of this lab is to draw a room with a table in it. The top of the table should produce a planer reflection. The reflection is created by texture mapping a reflection image onto the tabletop rectangle. The reflection image is generated by drawing the scene seen from an imaginary viewpoint, which looks through the table-top from under the table. This rendered image is then copied from the color buffer to a texture object, to be used for texture mapping the table-top rectangle.

Furthermore, a very simple flying bird has been added to the drawing.
